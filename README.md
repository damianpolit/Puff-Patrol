# Puff Patrol

Puff Patrol is open source discord bot to build global awareness about air conditional. Bot is focussing to notify users about air quality with as little integration into commands as possible. Our goal is to be able to "click" most options using UI elements, so that every age group will have no problem using the bot. Puff Patrol is also developed for linguistic accessibility - it is multilingual
